Web development from zero to hero!

Hi!

This will be my latest attempt at learning to code. :)
There's a saying that goes: "The best way to learn something is to teach it".
So the stream will be about me trying to present what I learned the day before. :)

I'll start with HTML, CSS, the DOM, and vanilla javascript.

When I got basic javascript syntax down I'll try to implement fundamental algorithms in it.
At this point I assume I'll have to get familiar with OOP at the minimum if not other paradigmes.
I will probably join a couple of coding challenge sites to practice these.

Then, since 90 % of the time your code will run on or will be hosted on some kind of a linux server I will look at different web stacks (lamp, lemp, etc) and see how they work.
This is where I plan to do some shell scripting, try ansible, chef, puppet and stuff like this and also learn git.
This is probably not absolutely necessary for client side html and javascript but I'd like to do this before I move on to server side stuff.

After this I plan to learn server side javascript (node.js) and CSS frameworks.

Next I will try to improve my skills by reading some books that are basically required reading for developers like "Code complete" and "19 (or 24?) deadly mistakes of software development" and others.
I will also try and improve the security of my code using OWASP guides.

When I feel like I got a solid enough foundation I'll probably try popular frameworks like Angular, React, Vue and the like.

Once I got the technical side down I'll try to focus a bit more on the aesthetics like the design best practices, typography etc.

Ultimately I'd like to play around with webgl, especially webvr and three.js because those google chrome experiments look dope af. :)
I also want to look at more well known APIs and see what can be done with those.

After I'm done with all the above I'll try to learn as much as I can about backend stuff.
This means of course learning php so I can develop for the more popular CMS-es like Wordpress or Drupal.

This will probably take anywhere from a couple of months to a year to complete. We'll see how it goes...

*I'll try to make a daily video, I plan to share my notes and links to materials on github.

**I'm talking in the videos so I can work on my speech disorders and improve my english.
**I realise I don't have the voice of a news anchor, I apologise in advance. :)
